                <h3>What is RCM (Reverse Charge Mechanism)?</h3>
                <p>The Reverse Charge Mechanism (RCM) under GST refers to a situation where the recipient of goods or
                    services is liable to pay the GST instead of the supplier. Typically, under GST, the supplier
                    collects and remits the tax. However, under RCM, the responsibility shifts to the recipient of the
                    goods or services.</p>
